# Pulumi Components

This directory contains reusable Pulumi components for different infrastructure layers.

## Structure

- **compute/**: Compute resources (ECS, EKS, EC2, Lambda)
- **storage/**: Storage resources (RDS, S3, EFS)
- **networking/**: Networking components (VPC, subnets, security groups, load balancers)
- **monitoring/**: Monitoring and observability (CloudWatch, alarms, dashboards)
- **security/**: Security components (IAM roles, policies, secrets management)

Each component should be self-contained and reusable across different stacks.
